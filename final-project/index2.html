      <p>My name is Samantha. Thank you for stumbling on my blog! I am a current university student who is always trying to get her hands on a new book to read. I have a soft spot for Fantasy, Romance, and Science Fiction books, but am slowly beginning to read other types of genres. I would love to create a conversation with you through this post, so please leave a comment about what you thought about a book! To tell you a little more about myself, I also am interested in travelling, writing, and cooking! Thanks for stopping by! </p>
