      <p>My name is Samantha. Thank you for stumbling on my blog! I am a current university student who is always trying to get her hands on a new book to read. I have a soft spot for Fantasy, Romance, and Science Fiction books, but am slowly beginning to read other types of genres. I would love to begin a conversation with you through this blog, so please leave a comment and I will get back to you!</p>
      <p>To tell you a little more about myself, in addition to reading, I also enjoy writing, spending time outdoors, and travelling. I also included a picture of me, with my good friend Afeefah who is on the left-hand side of this picture (in the white). It was great meeting you, and thanks for stopping by.  </p>
